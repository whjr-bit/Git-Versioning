Story

Once upon a time, in a forest , there lived a monkey who resided on a jamun(berry) tree , which was on the banks 
of a river. In the same forest , there lived a crocodile and his wife.. 
One Day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey 
offered him some jamuns(berries). The crocodile came back the next day , for more fruits , as he loved them . As days
passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.

One day, the monkey sent some fruits for crocodile's wife . She ate the fruits and loved them, but was jealous, as 
she did not like her husband spending time with the monkey. She told her husband "If the fruits are so juicy, I wonder
how sweet the monkey's heart will be ! " then said "Get me the heart of the monkey". The crocodile was not willing
to kill his friend but had no choice..
